- Hi, I’m @arawson
- I’m interested in web development, game development, and all sorts of miscellaneous scripts and tools.
- I’m currently learning Godot and how hot a Breadman TR2200C gets during baking so I can know if I can just design and 3D print a replacement gear for it.
- I’m looking to collaborate on: I don't know yet.
- You can reach me at my personal email: aaronmrawson@gmail.com
